One of the most beautiful shapes prsenting the orgin of math that could be drowing uisng python

The Mandelbrot set is a general class of fractal sets. Fractals are infinitely repeating patterns on different scales. 
In simple words, the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers, c, for which an infinite sequence of numbers, z0, z1, …, zn, …, remains bounded. There is a limit that the magnitude of each complex number in that sequence never exceeds. The Mandelbrot sequence is given by the following recursive formula:
